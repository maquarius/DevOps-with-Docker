# EXERCISE 1.4: MISSING DEPENDENCIES 
## To get the container running
```
docker run -d --rm -it --name looper-it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done
```
## To enter the input/output loop that is running there
```
docker attach looper-it
```

Since it complained about curl not being found, i entered in a seperate window the running container. In there i installed the missing programme:
```
$ docker exec -it looper-it bash
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install curl
```
