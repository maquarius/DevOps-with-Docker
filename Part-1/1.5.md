# EXERCISE 1.5: SIZES OF IMAGES
## Image sizes compared
- devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu has 83MB
- devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine has 15.7MB

## Checking secret message functionality
1. pull correct images:
    1. docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
    2. docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu
2. Run both docker images as containers with ( the last part is the container id i had locally):
    1.  docker run -d -it --name simple-web-service-alpine fd312adc88e0
    2. docker run -d -it --name simple-web-service-ubuntu 4e3362e907d5
3. Then to enter the ubuntu service:
    1. docker exec -it simple-web-service-ubuntu bash
    2. cat text.log
    3. Secret message is: Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
4. To enter the alpine service:
    1. i noticed that bash didn't work, so after googling it seems alpine doesn't have by default bash. Replaced it with sh instead. And also noticed afterwards this was mentioned in the exercise instructions.
    2. docker exec -it simple-web-service-alpine sh
    3. cat text.log
    4. secret message is: Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
